(\u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d or \u201cus\u201d), a Delaware corporation, is headquartered in Santa Monica, California. Our flagship product, Snapchat, is a visual messaging application that was created to help people communicate through short videos and images called \u201cSnaps.\u201dBasis of PresentationThe accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) for interim financial information. Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Snap Inc. and our wholly owned subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Our fiscal year ends on December 31. These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) in February 2024 (the \u201cAnnual Report\u201d).In our opinion, the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements include all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for the fair presentation of our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2024 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2024.There have been no changes to our significant accounting policies described in our Annual Report that have had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related notes.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Management\u2019s estimates are based on historical information available as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates.Key estimates relate primarily to determining the fair value of assets and liabilities assumed in business combinations, evaluation of contingencies, uncertain tax positions, and the fair value of strategic investments. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates our estimates compared to historical experience and trends, which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities.Future Stock Split to be Effected in the Form of a Stock DividendIn July 2022, our board of directors determined that it was advisable and in our best interest to approve a stock split to be effected in the form of a special dividend of one share of Class A common stock on each outstanding share of our common stock at a future date (the \u201cFuture Stock Split\u201d). In connection with the Future Stock Split, we entered into certain agreements (the \u201cCo-Founder Agreements\u201d) with Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy, our co-founders, and certain of their respective affiliates requiring them, among other things, to convert shares of Class B common stock and Class C common stock into Class A common stock under certain circumstances. The Future Stock Split will not be declared and paid until the first business day following the date on which the average of the volume weighted average price (the \u201cVWAP\u201d) per share of Class A common stock equals or exceeds $40 per share for 65 consecutive trading days. If this does not occur by July 21, 2032, the Future Stock Split will not be declared and paid, and the Co-Founder Agreements will terminate.In June 2023, in connection with a proposed settlement of a class-action lawsuit, and as amended in December 2023, we agreed to modify the conditions for the Future Stock Split, subject to various conditions, including judicial approval of the settlement. In February 2024, the settlement was approved by the court and the class-action lawsuit was resolved. The Future Stock Split will not be declared and paid until the first business day following the date on which (i) the VWAP per share of Class A common stock equals or exceeds $40 per share for 90 consecutive trading days (the \u201c90-Day VWAP\u201d) and (ii) the ratio of the 90-Day VWAP to $8.70 equals or exceeds the ratio of the average closing price of the S&P 500 Total Return index for the same 90 trading days for which the 90-Day VWAP was calculated to 8,862.85. If this does not occur by July 21, 2032, the Future Stock Split will not be declared and paid, and the Co-Founder Agreements will terminate.No adjustments have been made to share or per share amounts for Class A common stock in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the effects of the Future Stock Split as these triggering conditions have not been met.",

    "RevenueFromContractWithCustomerTextBlock": "RevenueWe determine revenue recognition by first identifying the contract or contracts with a customer, identifying the performance obligations in the contract, determining the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and recognizing revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.Revenue is recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. We determine collectability by performing ongoing credit evaluations and monitoring customer accounts receivable balances. Sales tax, including value added tax, is excluded from reported revenue.We generate substantially all of our revenues by offering various advertising products on Snapchat, which include Snap Ads and AR Ads, referred to as advertising revenue. AR Ads include Sponsored Lenses, which allow users to interact with an advertiser\u2019s brand by enabling branded augmented reality experiences.The substantial majority of advertising revenue is generated from the display of advertisements on Snapchat through contractual agreements that are either based on the number of advertising impressions delivered or on a fixed fee basis over a period of time. Revenue related to agreements based on the number of impressions delivered is recognized when the advertisement is served. Revenue related to fixed fee arrangements is recognized ratably over the service period, typically less than 30 days in duration, and such arrangements do not contain minimum impression guarantees.In arrangements where another party is involved in providing specified services to a customer, we evaluate whether we are the principal or agent. In this evaluation, we consider if we obtain control of the specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer, as well as other indicators such as the party primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in establishing price. For advertising revenue arrangements where we are not the principal, we recognize revenue on a net basis. For the periods presented, revenue for arrangements where we are the agent was not material.We also generate revenue from subscriptions and sales of hardware products. Sales of hardware products are reported net of allowances for returns. For the periods presented, all such revenue was not material.The following table represents our revenue disaggregated by geography based on the billing address of the customer:Three Months Ended March 31,20242023(in thousands)North America (1) (2)$733,388 $632,560 Europe (3)200,092 155,615 Rest of world261,293 200,433 Total revenue$1,194,773 $988,608 (1)North America includes Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central America.(2)United States revenue was $710.8 million and $612.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.(3)Europe includes Russia and Turkey. Effective March 2022, we halted advertising sales to Russian and Belarusian entities.Deferred revenue related to advertising and subscriptions, included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets, was $98.4 million and $93.7 million as of March 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. We expect a substantial majority of our deferred revenue to be realized in less than one year.",

    "EarningsPerShareTextBlock": "Net Loss per ShareWe compute net loss per share using the two-class method required for multiple classes of common stock. We have three classes of authorized common stock for which voting rights differ by class.Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to each class of stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of stock outstanding during the period, adjusted for restricted stock awards (\u201cRSAs\u201d) for which the risk of forfeiture has not yet lapsed.For the calculation of diluted net loss per share, net loss per share attributable to common stockholders for basic net loss per share is adjusted by the effect of dilutive securities, including awards under our equity compensation plans. Diluted net loss per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the resulting net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of fully diluted common shares outstanding. We use the if\u2011converted method for calculating any potential dilutive effect of the convertible senior notes due in 2025, 2026, 2027, and 2028 (collectively, the \u201cConvertible Notes\u201d) on diluted net loss per share. The Convertible Notes would have a dilutive impact on net income per share when the average market price of Class A common stock for a given period exceeds the respective conversion price of the Convertible Notes. For the periods presented, our potentially dilutive shares relating to stock options, restricted stock units (\u201cRSUs\u201d), RSAs, and Convertible Notes were not included in the computation of diluted net loss per share as the effect of including these shares in the calculation would have been anti-dilutive.The numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted net loss per share computations for our common stock are calculated as follows:Three Months Ended March 31,20242023(in thousands, except per share data)Class AClass BClass CClass AClass BClass CNumerator:Net loss$(258,022)$(4,172)$(42,896)$(275,851)$(4,681)$(48,142)Net loss attributable to common stockholders$(258,022)$(4,172)$(42,896)$(275,851)$(4,681)$(48,142)Denominator:Basic shares:Weighted-average common shares - Basic1,393,23222,528231,6271,327,22122,522231,627Diluted shares:Weighted-average common shares - Diluted1,393,23222,528231,6271,327,22122,522231,627Net loss per share attributable to common stockholders:Basic$(0.19)$(0.19)$(0.19)$(0.21)$(0.21)$(0.21)Diluted$(0.19)$(0.19)$(0.19)$(0.21)$(0.21)$(0.21)The following potentially dilutive shares were excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive for the periods presented:Three Months Ended March 31,20242023(in thousands)Stock options1,5803,155Unvested RSUs and RSAs145,364128,086Convertible Notes (if-converted)69,36889,379",

Interest expense related to the amortization of debt issuance costs was $1.6 million and $1.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Contractual interest expense was $1.8 million and $2.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.As of March 31, 2024, the if-converted value of the Convertible Notes did not exceed the principal amount. The sale price for conversion was not satisfied as of March 31, 2024 for the Convertible Notes, and as a result, the Convertible Notes will not be eligible for optional conversion during the second quarter of 2024. No sinking fund is provided for the Convertible Notes, which means that we are not required to redeem or retire them periodically.Refer to Note 7 in our consolidated financial statements in the Annual Report for additional details.Capped Call Transactions In connection with the pricing of the 2025 Notes, the 2026 Notes, the 2027 Notes, and the 2028 Notes, we entered into the 2025 Capped Call Transactions, the 2026 Capped Call Transactions, the 2027 Capped Call Transactions, and the 2028 Capped Call Transactions (collectively, the \u201cCapped Call Transactions\u201d), respectively, with certain counterparties at a net cost of $100.0 million, $102.1 million, $86.8 million, and $177.0 million, respectively. The cap price of the 2025 Capped Call Transactions, the 2026 Capped Call Transactions, the 2027 Capped Call Transactions, and the 2028 Capped Call Transactions is initially $32.12, $32.58, $121.02, and $93.90 per share of our Class A common stock, respectively. All are subject to certain adjustments under the terms of the Capped Call Transactions. Conditions that cause adjustments to the initial strike price of the Capped Call Transactions mirror conditions that result in corresponding adjustments for the Convertible Notes.The Capped Call Transactions are intended to reduce potential dilution to holders of our Class A common stock beyond the conversion prices up to the cap prices on any conversion of the Convertible Notes or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount, as the case may be, with such reduction or offset subject to a cap. The cost of the Capped Call Transactions was recorded as a reduction of our additional paid-in capital in our consolidated balance sheets. The Capped Call Transactions will not be remeasured as long as they continue to meet the conditions for equity classification. As of March 31, 2024, the Capped Call Transactions were out-of-the-money.Credit FacilityIn May 2022, we entered into a five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d) with certain lenders that allows us to borrow up to $1.05 billion to fund working capital and general corporate-purpose expenditures. Loans bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to (i) a term secured overnight financing rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) plus 0.75% or the base rate, if selected by us, for loans made in U.S. dollars, (ii) the Sterling overnight index average plus 0.7826% for loans made in Sterling, or (iii) foreign indices as stated in the credit agreement plus 0.75% for loans made in other permitted foreign currencies. The base rate is defined as the greatest of (i) the Wall Street Journal prime rate, (ii) the greater of the (a) federal funds rate and (b) the overnight bank funding rate, plus 0.50%, and (iii) the applicable SOFR for a period of one month (but not less than zero) plus 1.00. The Credit Facility also contains an annual commitment fee of 0.10% on the daily undrawn balance of the facility. As of March 31, 2024, we had $60.8 million in the form of outstanding standby letters of credit, with no amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility.",

    "CommitmentsAndContingenciesDisclosureTextBlock": "Commitments and ContingenciesCommitmentsWe have non-cancelable contractual agreements primarily related to the hosting of our data processing, storage, and other computing services, as well as lease, content and developer partner, and other commitments. We had $2.6 billion in commitments as of March 31, 2024, primarily due within three years. For additional discussion on leases, see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements. ContingenciesWe record a loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We also disclose material contingencies when we believe a loss is not probable but reasonably possible. Accounting for contingencies requires us to use judgment related to both the likelihood of a loss and the estimate of the amount or range of loss. Many legal and tax contingencies can take years to be resolved.Pending MattersIn November 2021, we and certain of our officers and directors were named as defendants in a securities class action lawsuit purportedly brought on behalf of purchasers of our Class A common stock, alleging that we and certain of our officers made false or misleading statements and omissions concerning the impact that Apple\u2019s App Tracking Transparency framework would have on our business. We believe we have meritorious defenses to this lawsuit and continue to defend the lawsuit vigorously. Based on the preliminary nature of the proceedings in this case, the outcome of this matter remains uncertain.The outcomes of our legal proceedings are inherently unpredictable, subject to significant uncertainties, and could be material to our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows for a particular period. For the pending matter described above, it is not possible to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss.We are subject to various other legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business, including certain patent, trademark, privacy, regulatory, and employment matters. Although occasional adverse decisions or settlements may occur, we do not believe that the final disposition of any of our other pending matters will seriously harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.IndemnificationsIn the ordinary course of business, we may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers, vendors, lessors, investors, directors, officers, employees, and other parties with respect to certain matters. Indemnification may include losses from our breach of such agreements, services we provide, or third-party intellectual property infringement claims. These indemnifications may survive termination of the underlying agreement and the maximum potential amount of future indemnification payments may not be subject to a cap. We have not incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnifications as of March 31, 2024. We believe the fair value of these liabilities is immaterial and accordingly have no liabilities recorded for these agreements at March 31, 2024.",
